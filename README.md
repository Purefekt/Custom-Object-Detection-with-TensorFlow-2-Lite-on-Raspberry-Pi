# Custom Object Detection with TensorFlow 2 Lite on Raspberry Pi
This repository continues from my [last project](https://github.com/Purefekt/Custom-Object-Detection-with-TensorFlow-2) where i built a custom object detector for my face using TensorFlow 2. Now i will export that model to TensorFlow 2 Lite so that i can run it on a raspberry pi 4.  
I had saved an unexported copy of my trained model which i will use to export to TensorFlow Lite.
